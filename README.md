# Kindlefodder 

Kindlefodder is a Ruby framework and a collection of recipes for translating
websites and webpages into Kindle ebooks that are easy to navigate and a
pleasure to peruse. Web browsers are good for scanning information, but Kindles
are a lot better when you want to block out distractions and actually learn
something.

The ebooks posted here will in most cases be derived from material published
under a Creative Commons license.  I am grateful to the original authors
for writing such good and useful material. They are welcome to take these
ebooks and recipes, modify them, and distribute them under their own name. 

## You can download these ebooks now

Here are a few Kindle ebooks generated with the Kindlefodder framework.  You
can download them and transfer them to your Kindle via USB.

The code used to generate this ebook is actually the evolutionary ancestor to
the kindlefodder project. That code is available in the
[docrails_kindle][docrails_kindle] project.

# Writing your own ebook recipes

Read on if you're interested in learning how to contribute recipes for turning
web documentation for other products and services into Kindle ebooks.

## Requirements

* Ruby 1.9
* ImageMagick (i.e. the `convert` command)
* You must be a fairly good at slicing and dicing HTML with [Nokogiri][nokogiri] 

[nokogiri]:http://nokogiri.org/

Also, download Amazon's [KindleGen 2][kindlegen] tool and put it on your PATH.

[kindlegen]:http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000234621

## How to write a recipe

Fork this project and git clone your fork. `cd` into the cloned git
directory.

Run `bundle install` to make sure you have the required dependencies
(nokogiri and kindlerb) in the gem path.

Create a recipe file in the `recipes/` directory.

Follow the `recipes/heroku.rb` recipe as a model. The requirements of a recipe
should be fairly simple and straightforward.

Once you finish your recipe, generate the ebook with this command:

    ruby -Ilib recipes/your_new_recipe.rb

If all goes well, you should have a nice Kindle ebook version of the web
documentation you processed.

Now submit a pull request on your fork so I can pull in your recipe.

All recipe contributors will be recognized and thanked heartily on this page.

If you're working on a recipe, you may want post a [Github issue][issues]
saying what you're working on and give it the "recipe in progress"
label. This will help prevent unnecessary duplication of effort.
